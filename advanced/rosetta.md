**macOS 13+**

Rosetta allows you to run Intel Linux executables in an Apple Silicon Linux virtual machine (using Apple Virtualization backend).

{% include toc.md %}

## Enable Rosetta
You can enable Rosetta by checking "Enable Rosetta (x86_64 Emulation)" in the wizard when setting up a Linux virtual machine. If you did not do this, you can go to the [Virtualization]({% link settings-apple/virtualization.md %}#macos-13-rosetta) tab and check "Enable Rosetta on Linux (x86_64 Emulation)".

## Mounting Rosetta Runtime
The Rosetta runtime is shared in a VirtioFS mount named `rosetta`. You can mount it with the following command:

```
$ sudo mkdir /media/rosetta
$ sudo mount -t virtiofs rosetta /media/rosetta
```

Here, we chose `/media/rosetta` as the mount point. You can use any path but you must change the rest of the commands.

### Mounting on Startup
In order to install the runtime, you need to have the share mounted at runtime. To do this, modify your `/etc/fstab` and add the following line:

```
rosetta	/media/rosetta	virtiofs	ro,nofail	0	0
```

## Enabling Rosetta
You will need the `update-binfmts` command installed which is usually part of the `binfmt-support` package. Register Rosetta as a x86_64 ELF handler:

```
$ sudo /usr/sbin/update-binfmts --install rosetta /media/rosetta/rosetta \
     --magic "\x7fELF\x02\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x3e\x00" \
     --mask "\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfe\xfe\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfe\xff\xff\xff" \
     --credentials yes --preserve yes --fix-binary yes
```

{: .warning }
When using Rosetta in macOS 13, set the `--preserve` option to `no`. On newer versions of macOS, it should be `yes`.

{: .note }
The `magic` parameter describes the first 20 bytes of the ELF header for x86_64 binaries. The Linux kernel performs a bitwise logical AND with the first 20 bytes of a binary a user attempts to run with the mask value. If it matches the magic value, the kernel uses the registered handler as the interpreter for that binary. If the system canâ€™t find a handler for the specified binary, it reports an error. See [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/running_intel_binaries_in_linux_vms_with_rosetta) for more details.

## Installing Shared Libraries
In order to run x86_64 executables, you still need to install shared libraries for x86_64. The instructions vary for different distros but usually involve enabling "multiarch" or "multilib" support.

- [Debian]({% link guides/debian.md %})

## Confirming Success

To test if your system now has binaries avaliable via the package manager you can run the following command to check if both `arm64` and `amd64` are avaiable. For example the 7-zip program:
```
sudo apt update
apt list p7zip-full
```
If you need to force install a program, you should also confirm it is an `ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64` file.
```
sudo apt install p7zip-full:amd64
file /usr/lib/p7zip/7z
7z b
```

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes dependencies might fail to install with unconfigured changes. To troubleshoot this issue:
```
sudo apt -f install -y
```
However packages might still fail to install due to not being able to use translation or not allowed to compile through Rossetta. 

One known limitation remains with **Snap Packages** due to each package containing all their dependencies and not being able to make use of the translation.
