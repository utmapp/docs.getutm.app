If none of the above methods worked, you may try enabling FTP or SFPT on the virtual machine.

For old windows builds, you can go to the [Control Panel] on your computer, open [Programs and Features],and click
[Turn Windows features on or off ].In [Internet Information Services], place a checkmark in
[FTP Service] and [IIS Management Console], and click [OK].

For other builds, you can download FTP software via the internet

Please note that FTP and SFTP require internet. (on old and new builds)
