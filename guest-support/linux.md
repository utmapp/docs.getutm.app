## Drivers
Most popular Linux distributions will have the correct drivers already built in. If you are building your own kernel, make sure to include the following options:
* `CONFIG_VIRTIO`
* `CONFIG_VIRTIO_RING`
* `CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI`
* `CONFIG_VIRTIO_BALLOON`
* `CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK` for storage devices
* `CONFIG_VIRTIO_CONSOLE` for console devices
* `CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET` for networking
* `CONFIG_DRM_VIRTIO_GPU` for graphical output
* `CONFIG_NET_9P`, `CONFIG_NET_9P_VIRTIO`, `CONFIG_9P_FS`, `CONFIG_9P_FS_POSIX_ACL` for VirtFS directory sharing
* `CONFIG_VIRTIO_FS` for VirtioFS directory sharing

To use the experimental OpenGL hardware acceleration features in the QEMU backend, make sure a [compatible display card is selected]({% link settings-qemu/devices/display.md %}#emulated-display-card) and the VirGL driver is enabled in Mesa.

## SPICE Agent
SPICE agent is required for clipboard sharing (both [QEMU]({% link settings-qemu/sharing.md %}#clipboard-sharing) and [Apple]({% link settings-apple/virtualization.md %}#macos-13-clipboard-sharing) backend) as well as dynamic display resolution in [QEMU]({% link settings-qemu/devices/display.md %}#auto-resolution) backend.

Most distributions will have a package named `spice-vdagent` but you can also build it [from the source](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/linux/vd_agent). Some common distributions and install instructions are listed below.

### Ubuntu, Debian, apt based

```
$ sudo apt install spice-vdagent
```

### Fedora, CentOS, RPM based

```
$ sudo yum install spice-vdagent
```

{: .note }
These systems will typically already have SPICE agent installed.

### ArchLinux

```
$ sudo pacman -S spice-vdagent
```

## QEMU Agent
Additional features such as time syncing and [scripting]({% link scripting/scripting.md %}) are supported by the QEMU agent.

### Ubuntu, Debian, apt based

```
$ sudo apt install qemu-guest-agent
```

### Fedora, CentOS, RPM based

```
$ sudo yum install qemu-guest-agent
```

### ArchLinux

```
$ sudo pacman -S qemu-guest-agent
```

## SPICE WebDAV
SPICE WebDAV is required for [QEMU directory sharing]({% link settings-qemu/sharing.md %}#spice-webdav) as an alternative to VirtFS.

Once SPICE WebDAV is installed and running, you should be able to access `http://127.0.0.1:9843` from inside the guest. This is a WebDAV share that you can mount using something like `davfs2`.

Most distributions will have a package named `spice-webdavd` or `phodav` but you can also build it [from the source](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/phodav). Some common distributions and install instructions are listed below.

### Ubuntu, Debian, apt based

```
$ sudo apt install spice-webdavd
```

### Fedora, CentOS, RPM based

```
$ sudo yum install spice-webdavd
```

### ArchLinux

```
$ sudo pacman -S phodav
```

## VirtFS
VirtFS enables [QEMU directory sharing]({% link settings-qemu/sharing.md %}#virtfs) as an alternative to SPICE WebDAV.

After making sure your Linux installation [supports 9pfs](#drivers), you can automatically mount the share by adding the following entry to your `/etc/fstab`:

```
# UTM Shared Folder
share /mnt/utm 9p trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,rw,_netdev,nofail,auto 0 0
```

_Note_: `share` is the name UTM uses for the VirtIO device and you should not change it. You can replace `/mnt/utm` with a different folder if you like.

After updating `/etc/fstab` you need to create an empty folder for the mount:

```sh
sudo mkdir /mnt/utm
```

You can apply the changes to `/etc/fstab` with the following commands (this will automatically happen on reboot as well):

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart network-fs.target
systemctl list-units --type=mount
```

A systemd `.mount` unit for `/mnt/utm` should now be displayed in the list, and you can access the contents of your shared folder.

### Fixing permission errors
You may notice that accessing the mount point fails with "access denied" unless you're the root user. This is because by default the directory inherits the UID/GID from macOS/iOS which has a different numbering scheme.

To fix this we are going to use [`bindfs`](https://bindfs.org/) to create a mount in the user's home directory that we can access normally. You have to first install `bindfs` with your system's package manager.

The first step is to get the UID and GID used by the host:

```
$ ls -na /mnt/utm
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 4 502 20  128 Feb 22 15:52 .
drwxr-xr-x 3   0  0 4096 Feb 22 14:50 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 502 20   13 Feb 22 15:52 shared-file.txt
```

In this case the UID for the host is `502` and the GID is `20`. You have to do the same for the guest user (usually UID `1000` and GID `1000`). Additionally, create an empty folder for the `bindfs` mount in the home directory:

```sh
mkdir /home/user/utm
```

_Note_: In this example the username is `user`, you might have to adjust this to match your configuration.

Now add another entry to `/etc/fstab`:

```
# bindfs mount to remap UID/GID
/mnt/utm /home/user/utm fuse.bindfs map=502/1000:@20/@1000,x-systemd.requires=/mnt/utm,_netdev,nofail,auto 0 0
```

An alternative solution is to recursively change the permissions of the files in your shared folder:

```
$ sudo chown -R $USER /mnt/utm
```

_Note_: This will not change the permissions on your host system, but it will add a custom `user.virtfs` file attributes to every file to store the guest ownership. It is not recommended to do this if you want to share your host's home folder for instance.

## **macOS**{: .label .label-green } VirtioFS
When using Apple Virtualization backend, [directory sharing]({% link settings-apple/sharing.md %}) is enabled through VirtioFS.

{: .note }
VirtioFS is NOT the same as [VirtFS](#virtfs) which is used by the QEMU backend for directory sharing.

After making sure your Linux installation [supports VirtioFS](#drivers), you can mount the share with the following command:

```
$ sudo mkdir [mount point]
$ sudo mount -t virtiofs share [mount point]
```

Where `[mount point]` is the desired destination path. For example: `/media/share`.

You can also modify `/etc/fstab` and add the following line to automatically mount the share on startup:

```
share	[mount point]	virtiofs	rw,nofail	0	0
```
